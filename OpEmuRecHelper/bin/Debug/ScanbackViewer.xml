            ScanbackViewer - GUI tool to study scanback/scanforth results.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            ScanbackViewer is oriented to give a detailed account of scanback/scanforth procedures 
            on a path-by-path basis rather than from a statistical point of view.
            </para>
            <para>
            The standard usage of this tool requires the following steps:
            <list type="number">
            <item><term>connect to a DB (using <see cref="T:SySal.Executables.ScanbackViewer.DBLoginForm">DBLoginForm</see>);</term></item>
            <item><term>select a brick;</term></item>
            <item><term>select a scanback/scanforth operation;</term></item>
            <item><term>select one or more available paths whose history is to be studied;</term></item>
            <item><term>click on the "Add" button to select a color for the paths and finally have them added to the 3D display.</term></item>
            </list>
            The paths displayed can be studied track-by-track. The selected color is used for base-track candidates, and a darker segment 
            connects base-tracks candidates found on different plates.
            </para>
            <para>Clicking on a plate marker shows information about the plate.</para>
            <para>Clicking on a base-track marker shows information about that base track, in the format: <c>PATH ID_PLATE FPX FPY FSX FSY</c>.</para>
            <para>Clicking on a base-track connector marker shows the full history of the corresponding path, in the format: <c>PATH ID_PLATE PPX PPY PSX PSY GRAINS FPX FPY FSX FSY Z</c>.</para>
            <para><c>F/PPX/Y</c> = [Found | Predicted] Position [X | Y]</para> 
            <para><c>F/PSX/Y</c> = [Found | Predicted] Slope [X | Y]</para> 
            <para>The path view is a 3D view provided by <see cref="T:GDI3D.Scene">GDI3D</see> and its <see cref="T:GDI3D.Control.GDIDisplay">Display Control</see>.</para>
            <para>By dragging the image with the <u>right mouse button</u> pressed, one can rotate/pan it.</para>
            <para>Default points of view are available (XY, YZ, XZ).</para>
            <para>To center the view on a particularly interesting point, click on <i>Set Focus</i> and then <u>left-click</u> on the interesting point.</para>
            <para>The image obtained can be saved to an <see cref="T:GDI3D.Scene">X3L</see> file, and/or it can be merged with an X3L file. This is typically used to overlap the scanback/scanoforth history with TotalScan results.</para>	
            <para>When the <c>Enable Detailed View</c> button is clicked, the next left-click near a scanback path will open an X3LView slave window with the details of all tracks seen in the scanback procedure, with the selected candidates enhanced by lighter colors. 
            A rainbow color code ranging from magenta (upstream) through red (downstream) will denote the Z level of tracks. Clicking on <c>Disable Detailed View will disable this function and switch back to the normal behaviour of left-click.</c></para>
