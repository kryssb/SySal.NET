            TSRMuExpand - command line tool to transform basetrack-based TSR files to microtrack-based TSR files, ready for insertion into DB.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>In common use, TSR files are generated starting from sets of basetracks (and promoted microtracks). In order for these TSR files to be inserted
            into the DB, they must be converted to files based on microtracks. Since TSRMuExpand does not perform any new reconstruction, the information to
            work back the path to original microtracks must be present in source TLGs.</para>
            <para>TSRMuExpand expects the following command line:</para>
            <para><example><code>TSRMuExpand.exe &lt;input TSR file path&gt; &lt;TLG list file&gt; &lt;output Opera persistence path for TSR&gt;</code></example></para>
            <para>Notice the input must be a file, whereas the output can be a file as well as a DB persistence path.</para>
            <para>The TLG list file allows TSRMuExpand to trace back, for each layer, the indices of tracks and their associated microtrack information. The file 
            should be formatted as a sequence of lines, each line with the format:
            <c>BrickId SheetId TLGpath</c> where <c>BrickId</c> is the ID of the brick, <c>SheetId</c> is the Id number of the plate, and <c>TLGpath</c> is the path to the TLG file used as the input for reconstruction
            on that plate.</para>
            <para>TLG files are valid for TSRMuExpand if they are MultiSection TLGs containing:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>A <see cref="T:SySal.OperaDb.Scanning.DBMIPMicroTrackIndex"/> section with the indices of original microtracks.</item>
            <item>A <see cref="T:SySal.Scanning.PostProcessing.SlopeCorrections"/> section with the measured thickness of emulsion layers and base, and the adjusted values of 
            slope correction parameters.</item>
            </list></para>
            All other sections are optional and are ignored by TSRMuExpand.
