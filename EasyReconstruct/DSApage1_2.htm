  Once you got possible primary tracks, either they are attached to the primary vertex (upstream) or not. If you believe that there is at least one track that has not been associated to the vertex, but should be attached, do the following steps:
  <ol>
   <li>On the main panel, type a name for a new vertex fit, and click "Vertex Fit"</li>
   <li>Add tracks to the vertex fit, using <b>Weight</b>=1; this can be done from the TrackBrowser "Vertex Fit" tab, and from the VertexBrowser "Vertex Fit" tab; the advantage of the latter is that all the tracks attached
   to an automatically reconstructed vertex are attached to the vertex fit, so it is not required to keep memory of which tracks have already been associated; a useful trick is to highlight tracks that have already been added (the "Highlight" checkbox
   is always present in the TrackBrowser</li>
   <li>On the vertex fit panel, click on "Convert to Vertex" to make a new vertex with these tracks.</li>
   <li>If there is only one prong, one still defines a fictitious vertex halfway in the lead plate that is immediately upstream: browse its track, open the "Feedback" tab and click on "Add single-prong vertex at Z"=-500</li>
   <li>Browse the new vertex, go to the "Feedback" tab on the VertexBrowser and check "Include vertex in feedback" and "Primary Vertex".</li>
   <li>Open the "Neighborhood" tab and click on "Quick Downstream Tracks"</li>
   <li><i>Optional: </i>without changing the settings, click on "Related Segments" and look for aligned segments in the lab reconstruction!</li>
   <li>Create a new vertex fit and repeat the procedure if you believe that the vertex can be improved</li>
  </ol>
  If you are in doubt whether a track is attached or not to the vertex, attach it: later you will be able to decide after manual checks.<br />
  <i>Warning: repeatedly creating new vertex fits and converting them to vertices will leave several invalid vertices (i.e. empty or with one track). These vertices will be discarded when the file is saved, but vertex numbering will change as a consequence.</i><br />
  <b>The main vertex found should be flagged: on its VertexBrowser, go to the "Feedback" tab and check "Include vertex in feedback" and "Primary Vertex".</b><br />  
  Manual checks are a useful source of information about the real topology of the event, and are usually needed to confirm/discard tracks with high slope. In order to have a list of the tracks related to the vertex to be visually inspected, 
  open the "Projection" tab in the VertexBrowser and define the file where you want to append lines, then click on "Append to". If <b>Downstream tracks</b> is selected, for each track downstream of the vertex the following segment search lines will be added to manual checks:
  <ul>
   <li>one segment at each plate between the track end and the vertex point;</li>
   <li>the segments at the last plates where a track has been seen, which is useful to check e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup>pairs, and to confirm that the track is not a fake; the number of plates checked is defined by <b>track layers</b>;</li>
   <li>one segment search for each plate upstream of the vertex, to check track disappearance; the number of plates upstream is defined by <b>stop layers</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  If <b>Upstream tracks</b> is selected, the same applies to upstream tracks, swapping downstream and upstream directions.<br />
  Notice that the output file is always appended and never overwritten.<br />
  The next step depends on the type of event:<br />
