  <h1>Decay Search Step #3</h1>
  <h2>Visual Inspection / "Manual checks" (contained in Steps 1,2,3 of the reference document)</h2>
  <div>
      Following these steps will minimize your workload for manual checks:<br />
      <ol>
       <li>Save the modified TSR file with a new name.</li>
       <li>Open the file produced by appending segment search lines in the previous steps and determine the first and last plate to be examined.</li>
       <li>Start with the most downstream plate.</li>
       <li>For each plate, take the marks and perform manual checks using VertigoScan7.2 or higher. The list of manual checks will be automatically ordered by ascending plate number. Flag base tracks and upstream/downstream microtracks. Flag segments not found with a negative number. Save the file at each step.</li>
       <li>Close the current display session, open the modified TSR file, add nothing from the DB and import the file of manual check results. Then open a new display session.</li>
       <li>Save the modified TSR file with the results of manual checks.</li>
      </ol>      
  Notice that the file with the results of the manual checks will now be ordered by plate.<br />
