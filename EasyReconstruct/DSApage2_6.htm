  <h1>Decay Search Step #2.6</h1>
  <h2>Search for segments connecting vertices or tracks (contained in Steps 2,3 of the reference document)</h2>
  <div>
      This step allows you to perform visual inspection to look for undetected micro/basetracks connecting two vertices or a vertex and a track, or two tracks.<br />
      <ol>
       <li>For each track that has no creation vertex, add a vertex by opening its TrackBrowser, going to the "Feedback" tab and clicking on "Add single-prong vertex at Z", using the default value of 500 &mu;m.</li>
       <li>For each pair of vertices (real or fictitious) that might be connected by undetected micro/basetracks, open the VertexBrowser of one of the two and go to the "Projections" tab.</li>
       <li>Deselect "Upstream tracks" and "Downstream tracks", select "Tracks connecting to vertex" and enter the id of the other vertex of the pair.</li>
       <li>Select the file where you want to put the segment search lines.</li>
       <li>Click on "Append To".</li>
      </ol>      
  Notice that the file with the results of the manual checks will now be ordered by plate.<br />
