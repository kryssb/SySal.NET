            <summary>
            A command-line tool to produce lists of Ids of tracks to be ignored during alignment.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>ExtractLinkedIndex reads a TotalScan Reconstruction Volume and produces the list of tracks that are found to be linked on a 
            chosen sheet.</para>
            <para>The output list can be produced in two formats:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item><term>ASCII file (if the output path extension is not .TLG): in this case, the first line will contain the <c>Index</c> word, 
            and will be followed by lines each one containing one id.</term></item>
            <item><term>TLG file (requires a MultiSection TLG): in this case, the list of Ids is appended in a 
            <see cref="T:SySal.Scanning.Plate.IO.OPERA.LinkedZone.BaseTrackIgnoreAlignment"/> section.</term></item>. Notice that the TLG file must already exist.
            </list>
