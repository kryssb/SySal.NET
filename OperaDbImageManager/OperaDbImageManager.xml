            <summary>
            Allows uploading images to the DB and downloading images from the DB.    
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>Images are stored in the <c>TB_EMULSION_IMAGES</c> table. This is linked to <c>TB_ZONES</c>, which in turn is linked to <c>TB_PROC_OPERATIONS</c>.</para>
            <para><b>Downloading images</b></para>
            <para>    
            In order to download images you must specify at least the brick and plate, or also the zone (optionally). 
            Then, all images linked to each zone in the specified set will be downloaded.
            The syntax is the following:
            <c>OperaDbImageManager /download &lt;path&gt; &lt;brick&gt; &lt;plate&gt; [zone]</c>
            as in the examples:
            <example><c>OperaDbImageManager /download c:\\temp\\ 1008622 54</c></example>
            <example><c>OperaDbImageManager /download c:\\temp\\ 1008622 54 1000010008888947</c></example>
            </para>
            <para><b>Uploading images</b></para>
            <para>Images can enter the DB only if information required about the brick, plate, machine, user, and settings used is filled.
            OperaDbImageManager performs all relevant tasks of creating process operation and zone; however, the information supplied must be 
            meaningful (i.e. the user, machine and configuration used must exist). If you don't have a configuration, please create one,
            filling the <c>SETTINGS</c> field with the relevant data taking parameters. While data are being uploaded, the operation number
            and zones are shown, so that they can be used later to publish the data set.
            The syntax to upload a set of files is the following:
            <c>OperaDbImageManager /upload &lt;brick&gt; &lt;plate&gt; &lt;series&gt; &lt;machine&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; &lt;minx&gt; &lt;maxx&gt; &lt;miny&gt; &lt;maxy&gt; &lt;txx&gt; &lt;txy&gt; &lt;tyx&gt; &lt;tyy&gt; &lt;tdx&gt; &lt;tdy&gt; &lt;calibrationop&gt; &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...</c>
            </para>
            <para>It is possible to enter as many files as needed in a zone. Different zones must be entered by different executions of the program. 
            User information is taken from the user DB access credentials, which can be managed by <c>OperaDbGuiLogin</c>.
            The machine can be identified through its name or ID; the configuration can be identified through its name (use "" if the description contains blanks)
            or ID; if the calibration operation is set to 0 or to a negative number, the <c>CALIBRATION_OPERATION</c> is set to NULL.
            The following example shows how to enter 3 emulsion images.
            <example><c>OperaDbImageManager.exe /upload 1008622 54 3 mic3_sa 1000010008878963 10000 10300 20000 20300 1.01 0.001 -0.00099 1.001 15 -35 0 a.bmp b.bmp c.bmp</c></example>
